We would like to do two things:
- compute the voltage at DUT
  - use this for diode test like:  
    < 0.1V = shorted (red), continuity test or failed diode
   0.1 .. 1.0 V = diode-like (green)
   1.0 .. (Vcc - 0.5 or so) = LED-like (orange)
   "railed" = nothing connected (leds off)
- compute the effective resistance of DUT for output on serial port


We will need to calibrate Rpu, but other than that i think we can 
follow this route:
- calculate Rpu current from Vcc and ADC voltages
- calculate 1Mohm current from ADC voltage
- substract 1Mohm current from Rpu current to get 7.5k and DUT current
- calculate 7.5k voltage at this current
- substract 7.5k voltage from ADC voltage to get voltage at DUT.
- and then you can get Rdut just by Udut / Idut

To calibrate Rpu, the simplest situation is with DUT=0R, thus
putting 7.5k and 1M in parallel.

This makes it be:
I = ADC / 7444
Rpu = (Vcc - ADC) / I

This comes up with 33160 ohm for me now, we'll test with that.

Units: resistances in ohms, voltages in mV, currents in nA
N.B. the actual code was later modified for currents in 10 nA units

Irpu = ((Vcc - ADC) * 1000000) / Rpu
Imohm = ADC * 1000000 / 1000000 ... so just ADC :P
Idut = Irpu - Imohm
Ur75 = (Idut * 7500) / 1000000
Udut = ADC - Ur75
Rdut = (Udut * 1000000) / Idut
 

Upper edge trim / vcc calibration:
Irpu = ADC;
Urpu = (Irpu * Rpu) / 1000000
Vcc = ADC + Urpu

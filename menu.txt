Idea for the 3-LED 1-button UI:

short tap/normal mode: Logic Probe
	(short tap does nothing, purposefully)

long press: Activate Alternative mode
	transition signals 7,0,mode,0
	any press takes back to normal, timeout takes to normal
	timeout = 30 minutes ish?, reset via activity in the mode


tri-tap: Alternative Mode Select (blinks 1-7 as mode number (mode,0,mode,0..))
	wait ~6s: forget AMS
	tap: next mode
	hold: select mode

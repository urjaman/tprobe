The 3-LED 1-button UI:

Leds are Red, Green and Orange (or Yellow).
They're read in binary as Red=4, Green=2, Orange=1 to
make 3-bit numbers (0-7).

short tap/normal mode: Logic Probe
	(short tap in normal mode does nothing, purposefully)
	Logic Probe means:
		no lights: high-Z
		red: zero logic level
		green: one logic level
		orange: activity (logic level is toggling)

long press: Activate Alternative mode
	transition signals 7,0,mode,0
	if no submodes (modes 5 to 7):
		any press takes back to normal
	if submodes (modes 1 to 4):
		short tap is next submode, a press back to normal
	exiting altmode is a short flash of 7
	submode is always 1 on entry to altmode
	indicating submode transition is 7,0,altmode,0,submode,0
	timeout is about 2 hours (except for battery check which is 5s. and deep sleep which is forever).

(tri-tap: 3 fast taps)
tri-tap: Alternative Mode Select (blinks 1-7 as mode number (mode,0,mode,0..))
	wait ~6s: forget AMS
	tap: next mode
	hold: select mode

Alt Modes:
	Mode 1: Voltmeter (ADC Readout)
		Submode 1 - Wide Range:
			0: under 0.5V
			1: 0.5V to 1.0V
			2: 1.0V to 1.6V
			3: 1.6V to 2.0V (1.8V)
			4: 2.0V to 2.7V
			5: 2.7V to 3.6V (3.3V)
			6: 3.6V to 4.5V
			7: 4.5V to Vcc  (5V)
		Submode 2 - Low Range:
			0: under 0.4V
			1: 0.4V to 0.6V
			2: 0.6V to 0.8V
			3: 0.8V to 1.0V
			4: 1.0V to 1.2V
			5: 1.2V to 1.4V
			6: 1.4V to 1.6V
			7: over 1.6V (if blinking, over/near Vcc)
		Submode 3 - High Range:
			0: under 2.0V
			1: 2.0V  to 2.95V
			2: 2.95V to 3.2V
			3: 3.2V  to 3.4V 
			4: 3.4V  to 3.65V
			5: 3.65V to 3.95V (good lipo)
			6: 3.95V to 4.35V (full lipo)
			7: over 4.35V
	Mode 2:	Diode / Resistance Test (output pullup)
		Submode 1: Diode
			Red: Shorted
			Green: Diode (under 1V)
			Orange: High Volt Diode (1V to Vcc - 0.5V, eg. LED)
			black: nothing connected / threshold near or over Vcc
		Submode 2: Resistance (idea: magnitude 10^n ohms)
			1: 0 - 74 ohm
			2: 75 to 749 ohm
			3: 750 to 7499 ohm
			4: 7.5k to ~75k	
			5: 75k to ~750k	
			6: 750k to ~7.5M
			7: over 7.5M
		Submode 3: Calibration
			You just hold the output to the ground for a sec (until
			the lights no blinky anymore). and then let go,
			and then the device returns to submode 1 after a bit of
			blinkenlights (during which the output must be disconnected from anything).
	Mode 3: PWM output with 50/50 Duty - variable frequency
		Submode 1: 15.625 Hz
			2: 250 Hz
			3: 1kHz
			4: 4kHz
			5: about 32.768 kHz
			6: 100 kHz
			7: 500 kHz
	Mode 4: PWM output variable Duty
		Frequency is from the last used submode in Mode 3.
		Duty cycle is submode / 8. (from 1/8 to 7/8).

	Mode 5: All LEDs ("Flashlight") + Output 1
		(no submodes)

	Mode 6: Battery or Vcc Voltage
		(lights same as ADC high range).
		(no submodes)

	Mode 7: Deep Sleep + Output 0
		(no submodes)

If the device is not going to be used in a while (so alt-mode memory is irrelevant),
recommended action is to use the deep sleep mode -- this will 
sleep until the button is pressed, instead of the automatic sleep mode
which might be woken up from by noise on the input line too.
